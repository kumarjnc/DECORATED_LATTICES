# Summary 
## Code to calculate dispersion, density of state (DOS), local density of state (LDOS) of decorated lattices solving tight binding models

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kumarjnc/DECORATED_LATTICES.git
```

# Example
## Band dispersion of Lieb lattice
```python
import numpy as np 
from numpy import tile
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#from numpy import linalg as LA
from scipy import linalg as LA
import math,cmath
```
